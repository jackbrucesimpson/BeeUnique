# BeeUnique

Program to track bees with unique tags.

## Running the Program

Execution scripts are located in the `bin` directory. You can modify them to point to the directory containing videos to process and where you want your data output.

#### Program 1: Track
Main tracking video that processes videos. Execute by running `bash track.sh` after modifying the following variables:
- `VIDEO_DIRECTORY` - set to the directory video files are stored in
- `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` - set to where you want to write your data out to

#### Program 2: Overlay
Overlays tracking and tag pattern classifications onto video. Execute by running `bash overlay.sh` - you can close the window by pressing 'q', and you'll need to edit the following variables:
- `FILENAME_PATH` - set to the path of the video you want to see
- `CSV_FILE_PATH` - set to the path of the csv file that was output by the tracking program
- `CREATE_VIDEO` - 1 (True) or 0 (False): Outputs 4K video of overlaid footage but slows down the program
- `OUTPUT_VIDEO_FILE` - set to the path and filename of the video you wish to output

#### Program 3: Combine Background

Combines the background images generated by each hour-long video into a single average image for each day. Execute by running `bash combine.sh` after modifying the following variables:

## Setup

### Dependencies
- Requires Linux/MacOS
- Python 2
- OpenCV 2

### Ubuntu Installation

#### System packages
`sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv python-pip exfat-fuse`

#### Python numeric libraries
`pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy sklearn cython h5py `

#### Machine Learning Libraries

If you want to set these libraries up to run on the GPU, please follow the steps at the bottom of this page rather than running the command below.

`pip install tensorflow keras`

### Building

Run the `build.sh` script in the `bin` directory to compile the tracking library

### Running Machine Learning Libraries on the GPU [Optional]

If you want to set this up to run on the GPU, then you need to have a machine with an Nvidia GPU and some additional libraries installed.

#### Install CUDA
Go to the [CUDA download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) page and download the local deb file.

Install the file with the following command (you may have to change the filename).  

```
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-8-0-local-ga2_8.0.61-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cuda
```

Add the following lines to your `.profile` file in your home directory and then load it with `source .profile`

```
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64\
                         ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
```

#### Install CUDNN

Download CUDNN 5.1 (Tensorflow has issues with versions > 6) and once you've extracted the file, navigate into the extracted directory and run the following commands

```
sudo cp -P include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda-8.0/include
sudo cp -P lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64
```

#### Install Python Libraries

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu keras
```
